Today we learnt about datattypes in Typescript. We learnt primitive data types which includes string, boolean, arrays and numbers. We used different functions on them to determine and learn what the functions do and how they work.Starting off with basic one liner function about their declaration and syntax we first learnt how to use them.

Now swtiching to the functions that can be used while using a specified type of variable for exapmle, string functions on string, array functions on array and number functions on number.
