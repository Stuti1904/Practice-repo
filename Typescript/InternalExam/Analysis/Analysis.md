In this internal exam, I was given the task of managing a feedback form when the delivery is successful. From the question that there will be 3 different entities namely- user, order and rating.
The first task would be creating a user module that will store userid and user name.
The second module will be order module that will only store the orderid and user id.
The third module will store ratings part, with order id, user id, rating and remark.

The next task will be getting a rating such that the rating should not be greater than 5.
When the rating is less than or equal to 5 we will display:
order id
user id
Rating and Remark

The next task is that we need to display the ratings that are less than 3
We also have to display the ratings that are equal to 5

Once that is done, we have to sort the list of ratings by username and also decreasing order of the ratings.
