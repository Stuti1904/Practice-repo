Today's assignment was to make 3 components of a website namely: header, body and footer using components. Components are like small lego pieces that can be plugged in to make a full website. Using components makes sections of code resuable resulting in lesser lines of codes and duplication. 

For this assignment we created four components:
1. For header- with two menus, home and about
2. For home section that contained some dummy text 
3. For about section that also contained some dummy data and some links
4. As for the footer component, it just contained some copyright claims.
